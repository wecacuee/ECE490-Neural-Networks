1. If you are ECE490, then you have to find another student to pair with.
2. If you are ECE590, then you can do project alone.


## Description
Write a 1-page project proposal that answers the following questions.

1. What problem do you want to solve using neural networks? Why is this
   problem important?

2. How do you plan to solve this problem? How would you have solved in ECE491
   or COS498?

3. What is hard about this problem? What knowledge is missing from ECE491 or COS498 that you are want to learn in this course?
