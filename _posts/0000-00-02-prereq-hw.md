Complete programming problems in Python.

# Problem 1

The factorial of a non-negative integer n , denoted by $n!$, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n . The factorial of n also equals the product of n with the next smaller factorial:

$n ! = n × ( n − 1 ) × ( n − 2 ) × ( n − 3 ) × ⋯ × 3 × 2 × 1 = n × ( n − 1 ) !$

For example,
$5 ! = 5 × 4 ! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.$
The value of 0! is 1, according to the convention for an empty product.

Write a recursive C function to compute factorial of a natural number n. It should pass the test_factorial function 10 times. test_factorial function is given. 

Download and edit the file [test_factorial.c]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/0000-00-02-prereq-hw/test_factorial.c) . Complete the funciton and submit the file as a separate file to brightspace.

# Problem 2

A natural number (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc.) is called a prime number (or a prime) if it is greater than 1 and cannot be written as the product of two smaller natural numbers.

Write a C function to calculate if a number is prime. Return 1 if it is prime and 0 if it is not a prime. If the number is not a prime number, then a factor exists. Return the factor as through a pointer.

Download and edit the file [test_prime.c](https://vikasdhiman.info/ECE490-Neural-Networks/assets/0000-00-02-prereq-hw/test_prime.c). Complete the funciton and submit the file as a separate file to brightspace.

# Problem 3

Write a C function named `days()` that determines the number of days from the turn
of the century for any date passed as a structure. The date structure should use the
template

```c
struct date {
    int month;
    int day;
    int year;
}
```

In writing the `days()` function, use the convention that all years have 360 days and each
month consists of 30 days. The function should return the number of days for any date
structure passed to it. Make sure to declare the returned variable a long integer to reserve sufficient room for dates such as 12/19/89.

# Problem 4: Loops and Functions

As a way to play with functions and loops, let's implement a square root function: given a number x, we want to find the number z for which z² is most nearly x.

Computers typically compute the square root of x using a loop. Starting with some guess z, we can adjust z based on how close z² is to x, producing a better guess:

$$ z -= (z*z - x) / (2*z) $$

Repeating this adjustment makes the guess better and better until we reach an answer that is as close to the actual square root as can be.

Implement this in the def sqrt provided. A decent starting guess for z is 1, no matter what the input. To begin with, repeat the calculation 10 times and print each z along the way. See how close you get to the answer for various values of x (1, 2, 3, ...) and how quickly the guess improves.

Next, change the loop condition to stop once the value has stopped changing (or only changes by a very small amount). See if that's more or fewer than 10 iterations. Try other initial guesses for z, like x, or x/2. How close are your function's results to the math.sqrt in the standard library?

(Note: If you are interested in the details of the algorithm, the z² − x above is how far away z² is from where it needs to be (x), and the division by 2z is the derivative of z², to scale how much we adjust z by how quickly z² is changing. This general approach is called Newton's method. It works well for many functions but especially well for square root. Newton's methods is particular form of gradient descent.)

# Problem 4: Probability and statistics

1. Write the definitions of Random Variable, Expectation, and Variance.
2. What is the difference between Expectation and a sample mean? When do they
   converge?
3. Write the three axioms (properties) of a Probability distribution (measure).
4. What is the difference between Probability density function,
   a Probability mass function and  Cumulative distribution function.
5. Prove that for any Random Variable $X$, the variance $V(X) = E[X^2] - E[X]^2$.
6. Prove that $E[X^2] > 0$
<!-- 4. Prove that the expectation is a linear. $ E[\alpha X + \beta Y] = \alpha
   E[X] + \beta E[Y] $ for any real scalars $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}$ and random variables $X$ and $Y$ under conditions of finiteness (all integrals are finite). -->
<!-- 6. Define independent random variables. -->

# Problem 5

1. What is an unbiased estimator?
2. What the bias and variance of an estimator?
3. Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ be a random sample of size n.
    1. Show that $X^2$ is a biased estimator for $\mu^2$.
    2. Find the amount of bias in this estimator.
    3. What happens to the bias as the sample size $n$ increases?
4. Aircrew escape systems are powered by a solid propellant. The burning rate of this propellant is an important product characteristic. Specifications require that the mean burning rate must be 50 cm/s. We know that the standard deviation of burning rate is $ \sigma = 2 cm/s$. The experimenter decides to specify a type I error probability or significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$. He selects a random sample of $n = 25$ and obtains a sample average burning rate of $x = 51.3 cm/s$. What conclusions should he draw?
